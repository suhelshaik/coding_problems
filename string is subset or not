PROBLEM:
	Check whether string ‘A’ is subset of string ‘B’ or not 
DESCRIPTION:
	Two strings are given. Initialise them into sets. using built-in-function ‘ISSUBSET()’ we compare whether ‘A’ is subset of ‘B’ or not. If function returns true then ‘A’  is subset of ‘B’ else not a subset.
SOURCE CODE:
a=set(input("enter first string:"))
b=set(input("enter second string:"))
if(a.issubset(b)==bool(1)):              #bool(1) refers to true i.e, boolian operater
    print("a is subset of b")
else:
    print("a is not subset of b")
INPUT:
enter first string: power
enter second string: empower
OUTPUT:
A is subset of b
ANALYSIS:
 	Using built-in-function ‘issubset’ we verify whether ‘A’ is subset of ’B’ or not. If true return ‘A’ is subset of ‘B’ else not a subset .
COMPLEXITY:
	Time complexity of the algorithm is ‘O(1)’
